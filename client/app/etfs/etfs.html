            <p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a like a stock in that it trades on an exchange, but is like a mutual fund in that it tracks an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. An ETF’s price changes throughout the day as it is bought and sold.  Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund does. </p>
            <p>An advantage of owning an ETF is that you get the diversification of an index fund and the ability to purchase as little as one share. Another advantage is that the expense ratios for most ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund. When buying and selling ETFs you have to pay the same commission to your broker that you’d pay on any regular stock order.  One of the most widely known ETFs is called the Spider (SPDR), which tracks the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index and trades under the symbol SPY. </p>
