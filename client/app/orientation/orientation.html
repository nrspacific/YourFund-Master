              <p>“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish and you feed him for a

              <p>This is our philosophy - to teach individuals how to invest and enable them to control their investment
                decisions. Your Fund enables you to design and create a customized, tailored fund of investments that is
                suited to your goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance. <br>
              </p>
              <p>Once you register, you learn about investing before you design your own fund or funds. If you are
                already familiar with investing, you can go directly to creating and managing your funds. <br>
