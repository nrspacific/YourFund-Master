            <p>When researching a company, it is very important to look at its financial statements.  These statements show a company’s financial performance and health.  Therefore it is essential that you learn how to understand and interpret them.   A company’s financial statements are used in fundamental analysis to help make investment decisions.</p>
            <p>The amount of information in a company's financial statements can be intimidating, but if you know how to analyze the data, the financial statements can provide a wealth of information.  There are three major financial statements: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement.</p>
            <div id="CollapsiblePanel2" class="CollapsiblePanel">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">The Income Statement</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>The income statement measures a company's performance over a specific time frame such as a month, a quarter (three months), or a year.  It shows how much money the company generated (revenue), how much it spent (expenses) and the difference between the two (profit) over a specific time.</p>
                <p>Published in a company’s annual report and quarterly Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the income statement contains the numbers most often discussed when a company announces its results.  It shows how well the company’s business is performing such as whether or not the company is making money.  Companies should be able to bring in more money than they spend or they won’t stay in business for long.  Companies with low expenses relative to revenue - or high profits relative to revenue - signal strong fundamentals to investors.  Strong fundamentals are good because that indicates the company is financially sound; it is profitable and has good cash flow.</p>
                <p>There are two main categories found on the income statement: revenue and expenses.</p>
                <h4>Revenue</h4>
                <p>Revenue, also known as sales, is the most straightforward part of the income statement. This represents all the money a company brought in during a specific time period.  Larger companies sometimes break down revenue by business segment or geography.</p>
                <p>The best way for a company to improve profitability is to increase its sales. For example, Starbucks Coffee has aggressive long-term sales growth goals which include expanding its stores worldwide. Consistent sales growth has been a strong driver of Starbucks’ profitability.</p>
                <p>The best revenues are those that (are consistent or continue to grow) each year.  Temporary revenue increases, such as those resulting from a short-term sales promotion, do not have the same quality as on-going continuous sales since they are only short-term revenue increases.  When the promotion ends, the revenue declines.</p>
                <h4>Expenses</h4>
                <p class="text_ital">There are various types of expenses, but the two most common categories are: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">Cost of goods sold (COGS) <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cost of goods sold is the expense that is directly involved in creating revenue.  It is the cost of producing or purchasing the products or services sold by the company.  For example, Target pays a supplier $4 for a box of soap, which it then sells to customers for $5.  When it is sold, Target’s cost of goods sold for the box of soap would be $4.</p>
                <p>Selling, general and administrative costs are those expenses involved in running the business. These include marketing, salaries, office supplies, utility bills, research and development, rent and other general costs associated with running a business.  SG&amp;A also includes costs such as depreciation and amortization, which are accounting concepts used to value an asset (such as machinery) over the life of that asset.  Machinery, as it is used and begins to age, becomes less valuable.  A company will expense part of the cost of that machinery each year that the machine is used. </p>
                <p>Finally, there are additional financial costs, such as taxes and interest payments.  These are monitored as well and featured on a company’s income statement. </p>
                <h4>The Bottom Line: Revenue - Expenses = Profit<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Total revenue minus total expenses equals profit, also known as net income.  There are several profit categories that show how the company is performing. </p>
                <p><br>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div id="CollapsiblePanel" class="CollapsiblePanel">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0"> Profit &amp;  Margins</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <h4>Gross Profit &amp; Gross Margins</h4>
                <p>Gross profit (also known as gross income) is revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). Using the Target example, the gross profit from the sale of the soap is $1 ($5 sales price less $4 cost of goods sold = $1 gross profit).  The ratio of the gross profit divided by revenue is called gross margin.  In this example, the gross margin is $1/$5 or 20%. As an aside, 20% can be a great, good, or bad gross margin percentage depending on the average gross margin percentage for the industry and the gross margin percentage for a company’s competitors. </p>
                <p>Companies with high gross margins will have a lot of money leftover to spend on other business operations, such as research and development or marketing.  An investor should keep a sharp eye out for downward trends in the gross margins over time. This is a sign of future problems facing the bottom line.  When cost of goods sold rises rapidly, they are likely to lower gross profit margins, unless the company can pass these costs onto customers in the form of higher prices.</p>
                <h4>Operating Profit &amp; Operating Margin</h4>
                <p>Operating profit (also known as operating income) is revenue minus both the cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A.  This is the profit a company made from its actual operations, but excludes certain expenses and revenues that may not be related to its central operations.  Operating profit measures how much cash the business makes as a whole, therefore some analysts consider it a more reliable measure of profitability.</p>
                <p>Operating margin is the operating profit divided by revenue.  A high operating margin can mean the company has effective control of costs or that sales are increasing at a faster rate than the operating costs.  In other words, for every dollar of revenue, a large percentage of that dollar is income.  Analysts view a high operating margin as desirable because this means that the company has a good cash flow and a good handle on its expenses.</p>
                <h4>Net Profit</h4>
                <p>Net profit (also known as net income) is the company's profit after all expenses have been paid.  It is the revenue minus the cost of goods sold, SG&amp;A and financial expenses such as interest expense and taxes.  Net profit is called the "bottom line" and is usually the number people refer to when they use the word "profit" or "earnings".  The net profit margin is obtained by dividing the net income by revenue.</p>
                <p>When a company has a high net profit margin, it can mean that it also has one or more advantages over its competition.  Companies with higher net profit margins have a bigger cash cushion to protect themselves during an economic downturn.  On the other hand, companies with low profit margins can get wiped out in a downturn.  Because of their healthy financial status, companies with higher profit margins are able to improve their market share during the hard times. This gives them a competitive advantage and leaves them better positioned when the economy improves.</p>
                <h4>Income Statement Conclusion</h4>
                <p>A company’s income statement can yield valuable insights into its fundamentals.  Increasing sales shows the first sign of strong fundamentals while increasing margins indicate improving efficiency and profitability.  It is a good idea to determine what the company’ sales and margins are compared to its industry peers and competitors.  You should look for changes in revenues, costs of goods sold and SG&amp;A to get a sense of the company’s profit fundamentals.</p>

            <div id="CollapsiblePanel3" class="CollapsiblePanel">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">The Balance Sheet</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial condition, is a snapshot of a company's health at a specific point in time.  The point in time could be the end of a month, quarter, or year.  It tells you how much a company owns (its assets) and how much it owes (its liabilities). The difference between what it owns and what it owes is called equity or "shareholder equity".</p>
                <p><span class="text_ital">The balance sheet is named because a business's financial structure balances in the following manner: </span><br>
                  <br>
                  Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity<br>
                </p>
                <h4>The Balance Sheet’s Three Main Components</h4>
                <p>The three main components of the balance sheet can tell investors a lot about a company's fundamentals.  These three are: Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Assets</span><br>
                    Assets represent the resources a company owns or controls at a specific point in time. These include items such as cash, inventory, machinery, land and buildings.  There are two main types of assets: current assets and non-current assets.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Current Assets</span>:<br>
                    <br>
                    Current assets are those assets that are likely to be used up or converted into cash within the next twelve months.  This twelve month timeframe is known as a business cycle.  Three important current assets are: cash, inventories and accounts receivables.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Cash</span>:<br>
                    <br>
                    Cash is necessary to run a business.  Cash offers protection against tough economic times and also gives companies more options for future growth.  Growing cash often signals a strong company performance.  It shows that cash is accumulating so quickly that management doesn't have time to figure out how to make use of it.  On the other hand, a decreasing cash supply could be a sign of trouble.  It is good that a company has a cash cushion (in other words has some cash on hand) in case of a financial downturn.<br>
                    <br>
                    If there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet for a short time, such as three or six months, that could be fine.  The company might be deciding if it wants to invest it in new machinery or research and development.  However, if a lot of cash is a permanent feature of the company's balance sheet, investors need to ask why the money is not being put to use.  A high cash balance could be because management has run out of investment opportunities or is too short-sighted to know what to do with the money.<br>
                    <br>
                    One way to see how a company is using its cash is to review the company’s annual report to see if they investing the cash in new factories or machinery.  The annual report would also show if the company is investing its money in interest-bearing accounts, is using the cash to buy back stock if management thinks the stock is priced below its value, or begin issuing a dividend.<br>
                    <br>
                    An example of a company with a lot of cash is Apple.  Even though Apple was investing a lot of its cash into research and development, it had a very high cash balances for many years.  Apple decided to issue dividends to its shareholders to bring down its cash balance and improve the shareholder’s investment.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Inventories</span><br>
                    <br>
                    Inventories are finished or partially finished products that haven't been sold.  Companies have limited money available to invest in inventory.  To generate the cash to pay bills and return a profit, they must sell the merchandise they have purchased from suppliers.  The inventory turnover ratio (cost of goods sold divided by average inventory) measures how quickly the company is moving merchandise through the warehouse to customers.  If inventory is growing faster than sales, it is almost always a sign of deteriorating fundamentals.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Accounts Receivables</span><span class="text_bld">:<br>
          <br>
          </span>Accounts receivables are uncollected bills from a company’s customers.  Analyzing how fast a company collects what it is owed can tell a lot about its financial efficiency.   If a company's collection period is getting longer, it could mean problems ahead.  The company may be letting customers stretch their credit in order to recognize higher sales.  This can be trouble later, especially if the customers face a cash crunch.  Getting paid quickly is preferable to waiting for it since some of what is owed may never get paid.  The faster a company gets its customers to pay, the sooner it has cash to pay for salaries, merchandise, equipment, loans, and best of all, dividends and growth opportunities.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Non-Current Assets</span><span class="text_bld">:<br>
          <br>
          </span>Non-current assets are defined as anything that is not a current asset. This includes a company’s property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) which are known as fixed assets.  Unless the company is in financial distress and is liquidating its assets, investors do not need to pay too much attention to fixed assets.  Companies are often unable to sell their fixed assets within a reasonable timeframe such as three to six months.  Fixed assets are listed on the balance sheet at their cost to the company, regardless of their actual value.  As a result, it is possible for companies to inflate this number, leaving investors with questionable and hard-to-compare asset figures.  One way to check this is to compare the non-current asset values from the prior annual report to the current annual report to see if the values have changed.  If the company has not invested in new equipment, the property, plant and equipment amount should have decreased. <br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><strong>Liabilities</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Liabilities represent debt which must be paid back.  There are two categories of liabilities: current liabilities and non-current liabilities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Current liabilities are the payments a company owes that are due within the next twelve months, including payments owed to suppliers.  Non-current liabilities are payments that have a due date more than a year out and include items such as bank and bondholder debt.<br>
                    <br>
                    A low amount of debt is a good sign of a company’s financial health.  Falling debt levels are also a good sign.  A company with more assets than liabilities is considered to be in good financial shape.  On the other hand, a company with more liabilities than assets should be closely examined.  A company that has too much debt relative to the cash that is required to pay its interest and debt can eventually go bankrupt.<br>
                    <br>
                    A helpful tool to determine this is the quick ratio.  The quick ratio measures a company’s ability to pay its current debts by taking the current assets, subtracting the inventory and then dividing that number by the current liabilities. If the quick ratio is 1 or higher, it indicates that the company has enough cash and other current assets to cover its short-term debt obligations.<br>
                    <br>
                    Quick Ratio =<br>
                    Current Assets - Inventories<br>
                    _______________________<br>
                    <br>
                    Current Liabilities<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Equity</span><br>
                    <br>
                    Equity is the total value of the money that the owners have contributed to the business.  Equity is what the shareholders own, so it is often called shareholders’ equity.  Equity is total assets minus total liabilities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Equity = Total Assets – Total Liabilities<br>
                    <br>
                    There are two important equity components: paid-in capital and retained earnings.  Paid-in capital is the amount of money shareholders paid for their shares when the stock was first offered to the public.  It is the money the company received when it sold its shares.  Retained earnings are the profits made in previous years.  This is the money the company has chosen to reinvest in the business rather than pay to shareholders in the form of dividends.  Investors should look closely at how a company puts retained capital to use and how a company generates a return on it.</li>

            <div id="CollapsiblePanel4" class="CollapsiblePanel">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Cash Flow Statement</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>The cash flow statement, also called “change in working capital”, shows how much cash comes in and goes out of the company over a quarter or a year.  This sounds like the income statement in that it records financial performance over a specific period, but there is a big difference between the two.</p>
                <p>The difference between the two is that the income statement uses accrual accounting.  Accrual accounting requires companies to record revenues and expenses when transactions occur, not when cash is exchanged.  The income statement often includes non-cash revenues or expenses such as depreciation.  On the other hand, the cash flow statement does not include any non-cash items.</p>
                <p>For example, the income statement could show net income of $10, but this does not means that cash on the balance sheet will increase by $10.  When the bottom of the cash flow statement reads $10 net cash inflow, that's exactly what it means.  The company has $10 more in cash than at the end of the last financial period. The net cash from operations is the company's "true" cash profit.</p>
                <p>The cash flow statement shows how the company is able to pay for its operations and future growth.  As a potential investor, one of the most important factors you should be examining is a company’s ability to produce cash. Just because a company shows a profit on the income statement doesn't mean it is immune to trouble later on due to insufficient cash flows.  Examining the cash flow statement of a company is a good indicator of how the company will do.</p>
                <p class="text_ital">A statement of cash flows usually focuses on the following cash-related activities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Operating Cash Flow (OCF):</span> cash that is generated from day-to-day business operations.</li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Cash From Investing (CFI):</span> cash that is used for investing in assets, as well as the proceeds from the sale of other businesses, equipment or long-term assets.</li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Cash From Financing (CFF):</span> cash that is paid or received from the issuing and borrowing of funds.  This includes loans.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The cash flow statement is important to review because it is very difficult for a business to manipulate its cash situation.  In other words, it’s tough to fake cash in the bank.  Many investors use the cash flow statement as a more conservative measure of a company's true performance.</p>
                <h4>Cash Flow Statement - Three Main Sections</h4>
                <p>Companies earn and use cash in different ways, so the cash flow statement is divided into three sections: cash flows from operations, cash flows from investing, and cash flows from financing.</p>
                <h5>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:<br>
                </h5>
                <p>This section of the cash flow statement shows the amount of cash coming from sales of the company's goods and services, less the amount of cash needed to make and sell those goods and services (cost of goods sold, also known as “COGS”). </p>
                <p>The Cash Flow from Operations section is the cash version of net income. Net income includes non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization, but excludes other cash expenditures such as purchases of plants or equipment.  Companies that produce a net positive cash flow from operating activities usually perform well.  Of course, there are several examples of companies that display poor cash flow and go on to become good performers. For example, growth companies such as technology firms tend to have negative cash flow from operations in their formative  years and go on to be quite successful.</p>
                <p>This “changes in cash flow from operations” section can sometimes indicate that there will be changes in net future income.  It is usually a good sign when the change in cash from operating activities goes up. </p>
                <p>Investors should be careful of an increasing gap between a company's net income and its cash flow from operating activities.  For example, if net income is much larger than cash flow from operations, it's a sign that the quality of the company's net income is questionable.  On the other hand, if the cash flow from operations is greater than the net income, the company may be healthier than its net income suggests.  As an example, a pharmaceutical company shows net income of only $50 million.  Its cash flow from operations is $230 million. One of the reasons for the large difference is that the large depreciation and amortization charges reduce net income, but since they really aren't cash outlays, these charges have no effect on cash flow. <br>
                </p>
                <h5>Cash Flows from Investing Activities:<br>
                </h5>
                <p>This section of the statement shows the amount of cash the company has spent on capital expenditures such as new equipment or anything else needed to keep the business going.  The company is “investing” in itself.  This section also includes acquisitions of other businesses and monetary investments such as money market funds.</p>
                <p>It is a good rule of thumb for a company to reinvest cash back into its business by at least the rate of depreciation expenses each year.  If the company does not re-invest, it might show artificially high cash inflows in the current year which may not be sustainable.</p>
                <h5>Cash Flow From Financing Activities:<br>
                </h5>
                <p>This section of the statement describes the cash activities associated with outside financing.  Usual sources of cash inflow would be cash raised by selling stock and bonds or by borrowing from a bank. Cash outflows or use of cash in this section would include paying back a bank loan, dividend payments and common stock repurchases.</p>
                <h4>Free Cash Flow<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Knowledgeable investors are attracted to companies that generate a lot of free cash flow (FCF).  Free cash flow is the excess cash produced by the company.  Free cash flow indicates a company's ability to pay debt, pay dividends, buy back stock and facilitate the growth of business.  </p>
                <p class="text_ital">The most common method of calculating free cash flow is:<br>
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net Income<br>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <h4>Finding the Financial Statements: the 10-K and 10-Q<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) requires all publicly traded companies to file periodic reports detailing their financial activities.  These include the 10-K and 10-Q reports.  These reports can be found on the internet (sec.gov/edgar, annualreports.com, the company’s website) or in printed  form (you can e-mail or call the company to ask them to send you a printed copy).</p>
                <h4>The 10-K and the Annual Report<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The 10-K is an annual report that discloses a business's performance for the company’s fiscal year. A fiscal year is a twelve month timeframe that the company designates for its business cycle.  It could be January to December like the calendar year, or it could be April to March. </p>
                <p>The 10-K is audited by an accounting company that is an unbiased, outside organization.  In addition to finding a company's financial statements for the most recent year, investors can use the 10-K to access a business's historical financial measures along with information detailing the operations of the business. This information includes the number of employees, biographies of upper management, risks, future plans for growth, etc.</p>
                <p>Companies also release an annual report.  The annual report is basically the 10-K, but in a fancier, glossier format that functions more like a marketing piece meant for general investors.  It includes most of the same information  contained in the 10-K.  There is a great amount of valuable information in a 10-K and it is considered required reading for any serious investor.</p>
                <h4>The 10-Q<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The 10-Q filing can be thought of as a smaller version of the 10-K.  It reports the company's performance after each fiscal quarter (the “Q” stands for quarter).  Each year, three 10-Q filings are released - one for each of the first three quarters of the company’s fiscal year.  There is no 10-Q for the fourth quarter because the 10-K filing is released at that time.  10-Q filings are not required to be audited.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Other company information</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>Other company information that is required by the SEC includes a management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A), an auditor's report, and a detailed description of the company's operations and prospects for the upcoming year.</p>
                <h4>Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)<br>
                </h4>
                <p>As a preface to the financial statements, a company's management will talk about the recent year (or quarter) and provide background on the company.  This is called the management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A).  This provides a clearer picture of what the company does as well as pointing out some key areas in which the company has performed well.</p>
                <p>The management discussion does not delve into all the details affecting the company's performance.  The management's analysis is at their own discretion, therefore they tend to focus less on any potential negative aspects. </p>
                <p class="text_ital">As a potential investor, here are some things to look out for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">How accurate are management's comments?</li>
                  <li class="ul">Does management discuss significant financial trends over the past couple of years? <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">How clear are management's comments? If executives try to confuse you with big words and jargon, perhaps there is something to hide.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">Do they mention potential risks or uncertainties moving forward?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a company gives a decent amount of information in the MD&amp;A, it is likely that management is being upfront and honest.  If the MD&amp;A ignores serious problems that the company has been facing, this should raise a red flag.</p>
                <h4>The Auditor's Report<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The auditor’s job is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are accurate and provide adequate disclosure.</p>
                <p>Every publicly traded company is required by law to have its annual reports audited by a certified public accountants firm.  An auditor's report is meant to scrutinize the company and identify anything that might undermine the integrity of the financial statements.</p>
                <p>Audits give credibility to the figures reported by the management.  You'll only see unaudited financials for unlisted firms (those that trade OTCBB or on the Pink Sheets).  While quarterly statements aren't audited, you should be wary of annual financials that haven't been given the accountants' seal of approval.  If the annual financials have been audited, the 10-K and annual report will contain a letter stating that the financial statements have been audited by the accounting company. </p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">The Notes to the Financial Statements</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>Just as the MD&amp;A is an introduction to the financial statements, the notes to the financial statements, also called footnotes, complete the overall picture.  If the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are the heart of the financial statements, then the footnotes are the arteries that keep everything connected. </p>
                <p>The footnotes list important information such as outstanding leases, the maturity dates of outstanding debt and details on compensation plans, such as stock options, etc.  There are two types of footnotes:</p>
                <h4>Accounting Methods<br>
                </h4>
                <p>This type of footnote identifies and explains the major accounting policies that the company uses.  This is important if a company has changed accounting policies.  It may be that a firm is practicing "cookie jar accounting" and is changing policies only to take advantage of current conditions in order to hide poor performance.</p>
                <h4>Disclosure<br>
                </h4>
                <p>This type of footnote provides additional information that could not be put in the financial statements. The financial statements are supposed to be clean and easy to follow. To maintain this cleanliness, other calculations are left for the footnotes.  For example, details of long-term debt such as maturity dates and the interest rates at which debt was issued gives you a better idea of the timing of the borrowing costs.  Other disclosure areas include pension plan liabilities for existing employees to details about legal proceedings involving the company.</p>
                <p>Wise investors should dig deep and look for information that others typically overlook.  No matter how boring it might be, read the fine print - it will make you a better investor and help you realize your goals more efficiently.<br>
