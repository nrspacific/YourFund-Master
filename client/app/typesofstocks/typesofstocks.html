            <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company issues shares of stock on a stock exchange in order to raise funds for its business expansion.  Learn about investment concepts such as time value of money, inflation, and risk.</p>
            <p class="text_ital">There are two main types of stocks: </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Common stock</span> shareholders are actually considered owners of the corporation.  When the company does well, shareholders benefit from the increased earnings via a rising stock price and dividends.  Stockholders are not personally liable for the corporation’s debts but if the company fails or has to liquidate its assets, common stockholders are the last to be paid.  Owners of common stock are entitled to participate in certain aspects of managing the company, such as voting to elect directors and approving specified changes in the company’s charter.  The majority of stocks traded are common stocks.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Preferred stock</span> shareholders are also owners of the corporation.  Owners of preferred stock have the same rights as common stock shareholders.  However, unlike common stockholders, they are entitled to a fixed dividend. This is similar to a bondholder who receives interest on a bond.  Preferred shareholders are entitled to receive their dividends before common shareholders do.  Some preferred shares are convertible into a fixed number of common shares.  Preferred stocks are not as widely available as common stocks, and not all companies offer them. You can purchase preferred stock the same way you purchase common stock. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stock Classifications</h3>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Blue Chip Stocks</span> are stocks of companies with the strongest long-term performance.  They represent financially stable companies with a history of paying steady dividends during economically good and bad years.  These companies are usually the leaders within their industry or industry segment.  Blue chip stocks include all of the Dow Jones 30 industrial companies as well as the stocks of other large, successful companies.  Because blue chip stocks have high levels of quality and relative stability, they are viewed as attractive long-term investments.  Blue Chip stocks include Exxon, Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric. </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Combined Return Stocks</span> are shares of companies that have characteristics of both income and growth stocks.  They offer a combined return through dividends and price appreciation.  These stocks usually do not have as high a dividend yield as an income stock, nor earnings growth as high as a growth company stock.  Examples of combined return stocks include well established technology companies.Combined Return stocks include Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. <br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Cyclical Stocks</span> are shares of companies that are influenced by the economy and their industry’s business cycle.  When the economy is doing well, the company’s profitability increases and the stock price rises.  When economic conditions deteriorate, business for the cyclical company decreases and its profit declines.  Cyclical industries include steel, paper, machinery, transportation, housing, oil and other natural resources.  Cyclical stocks include US Steel, KB Homes, and Lennar. </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Defensive Stocks</span> are shares of companies that are counter-cyclical and are more stable when the economy faces a period of uncertainty or decline.  Prices of these stocks tend to remain stable during periods of economic downturn.  These industries include food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, utilities and tobacco.  Defensive stocks are usually recession-resistant.  Defensive stocks include Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Bayer.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Growth Stocks</span> are shares of companies whose sales, earnings and share of the market are expanding faster than the overall economy and also faster than their industry average.  The growth company usually focuses on research and reinvests its earnings into expansion.  For this reason, growth companies pay relatively small dividends, if at all.  Growth stocks are usually riskier and quite volatile.  Their price can go up faster and farther than other stocks, but if the high rate of earnings levels off or is not sustained, prices can come tumbling down.  Examples of growth stocks are rapidly growing technology companies with very strong sales.  Growth stocks are better suited for investors with long-term time frames who are willing to assume the risk of a volatile stock.  Examples of Growth stocks are Apple, Salesforce, and VMware.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Income Stocks</span> are shares of companies with a long, sustained record of paying high dividends.  Generally, income stocks are in fairly stable and mature industries such as telephone and public utilities.  These companies usually pay out a relatively high percentage of their earnings as dividends to stockholders.  Because these companies distribute rather than reinvest their earnings, they are less likely to rise as high as growth stocks. They are also more likely to be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.  Income stocks are popular with people who need current cash flow from their stock investments.  Examples of Income stocks are AT&amp;T, Verizon, Pfizer.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Interest-Sensitive Stocks</span> are shares of companies whose performance are influenced by interest rates.  When interest rates rise, mortgage rates increase and property sales and construction declines.  This decreases the demand for building supplies such as lumber, plumbing and household equipment.  Conversely, when interest rates fall, mortgage rates decrease and home sales increase, boosting the demand for these supplies.  Other types of interest-sensitive companies include life insurance, banks and utilities.  Examples of Interest-Sensitive stocks are Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Metlife.</li>
