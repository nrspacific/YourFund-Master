            Do you like the gaming tables in Las Vegas or Atlantic City? Do you wait until the gas gauge is almost on
            "E" before you fill up? If you answered yes to either, then you are probably a risk taker. Investing is
            ultimately a form of risk.<p></p>

            The risk of investing in a security (for example a stock or bond) is the chance that the investment will
            decline in value and you will lose your initial investment as well as any potential future gains. For
            example, imagine that you buy shares in XYZ company that makes compact fluorescent light bulbs. Six months
            later, another company introduces a new light bulb that is less expensive and more energy efficient. Sales
            of compact fluorescent light bulbs plunge and so does XYZ company's stock price. The value of your
            investment is now below what you paid for it.<p></p>

            Risk and return are directly related, so an investment that offers higher potential returns generally
            carries a higher risk. This is true in gambling as well. Let's say you're in Las Vegas playing Roulette. If
            you bet on number 18 at the roulette wheel, you have selected a very specific item with a 1 in 37 chance of
            winning. This is a very risky bet so if you win, you get a large payoff (return). On the other hand, if you
            bet on the color red (a more general bet), you have almost a 1 in 2 chance of winning. Thus the odds (risk)
            are lower, but the payoff is consequently smaller as well.<p></p>

            Unlike gambling, however, investing in the stock market is not based purely on chance. It involves
            thoroughly researching a company, analyzing the company's track record and assessing its potential to
            generate future income. While gambling is a one-time, immediate event, smart investing occurs over a longer
            period of time.<p></p>

            Generally, debt securities (i.e. bonds) have lower risks and offer lower returns while equity securities
            (i.e. stocks) have higher risks and offer higher returns. Highly risky investments, such as commodities
            (i.e. gold, silver) and hard assets (i.e. real estate), have the best potential for highest returns over
            time. However, these investments are the hardest to sell quickly and have the highest risk of declining in
            value.<p></p>

            Your Risk Tolerance Level indicates your emotional and financial ability to tolerate investment losses.
            People who don't like to gamble have a low risk tolerance level while people who enjoy gambling tend to have
            a high risk tolerance level. Over time, your risk tolerance level may increase or decrease as your
            investment knowledge, net worth, income or age changes. Generally, the younger and/or wealthier you are, the
            more you can afford to make risky investments.<p></p>

            Measuring Your Attitude Toward Risk<p></p>

            <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
              <p>It is a good idea to gauge your attitude about risk. The following statements can help you determine
                your risk tolerance level. Select “Yes”, “No” or “Unsure” based on the assumption that you are investing
                money that will remain in the market over the next five years. Remember, there are no right or wrong
                answers.</p>

                <p>A stock’s risk is measured by the volatility (degree of variation) of its stock price. This measure
                  is called “beta”. Beta measures the volatility of a security’s return relative to the stock market.

                  Poor’s 500 index. <br>
                  <br>
                  In measuring risk, a beta of 1 means that the stock’s price is moving exactly with the market index. A
                  beta lower than 1 indicates that the stock’s price does not fluctuate as much as the overall stock
                  market while a beta higher than 1 indicates that the stock’s price fluctuates more than the market.
                </p>

                <p>For example, Stock A has a beta of .65 and is 35% less volatile than the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500
                  index. Stock B has a beta of 1.4 and is 40% more volatile than the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index.
                  Therefore, Stock B is the riskier investment choice. If you are risk-averse, you might find Stock A
                  and other low-beta stocks as attractive options to add to your investment portfolio. If you like high
                  risk with the potential of high returns, you would select Stock B and other high-beta stocks. </p>

                <p>Stocks with high betas tend to rise more sharply than the market and can provide greater
                  profitability in the long run. High-beta stocks tend to rise more than low-beta stocks in an
                  increasing stock market, but perform much worse in a declining market. </p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Types of Risk</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>Investments can be affected by various types of risk. </p>

                <p class="text_ital">Here are a few that you should be aware of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Business Risk</span> is the potential that a company may not
                    perform well. One cause of business risk is the uncertainty about the company’s profitability. An
                    example of this would be a biotechnology company that is focused on only one drug. If the drug fails
                    to gain FDA approval, the stock of that biotechnology company might plummet.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Callability Risk</span> is the chance that the bond issuer may
                    force bondholders to redeem their bonds before the bonds reach maturity. Callable bonds are those
                    that the company can redeem before they mature. You would get your entire investment back plus the
                    interest that is already paid. For example, if you have a 10 year, $1,000 bond which pays 10%
                    interest annually, you receive $100 each year for 10 years. If the issuer “calls” the bond after the
                    second year, you would have only received $200 of interest plus your $1,000 principal. You would not
                    receive the eight additional years worth of interest payments or $800.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Default Risk</span> is the possibility that a corporation or
                    other bond issuer will fail to make payments on the bond’s interest and principal. Companies might
                    not be able to pay the interest or principal on their bonds due to adverse financial conditions or
                    bankruptcy. The degree of default risk is related to the financial condition of the company issuing
                    the security. If a bankruptcy occurs, bondholders do have a claim on the company’s assets, but might
                    not get all their money back.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Interest Rate Risk</span> is a change in the price of a bond
                    caused by market interest rate fluctuations. The majority of bonds have a fixed coupon, which means
                    that you will be paid the fixed interest rate stated on the bond. If the market interest rate
                    increases, the price of an existing bond with a coupon rate below that of the current market rate
                    will decrease. This is because coupon income on the existing bonds is fixed and does not increase
                    when the interest rate increases.<br>
                    <br>
                    For example, you purchase a $100 bond with a 10% coupon so you would receive $10 per year in
                    interest. One year later interest rates increase to 12%. The 12% bond would pay $12 per year in
                    interest. Your 10% bond is not worth as much as a 12% bond on the market. Why buy a 10% bond paying
                    $10 annually when you can buy a 12% bond that is paying $12 annually? If you wanted to sell your
                    bond, you would need to sell it at a discount.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Investment Risk</span> is the potential that your initial
                    investment may not yield the return you expect each year. Although it may return more than expected
                    in some years, it may return less than expected in others. Some years, it may even have a negative
                    return (i.e. loss of principal).
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Liquidity Risk</span> is the potential inability to sell the
                    investment quickly. For example an investor might sell an investment at a discount if he or she
                    needed to quickly convert that investment into cash. Trying to sell a house quickly in a recession
                    is an example of liquidity risk.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Market Risk</span> is when sharp fluctuations of the market
                    affect all stocks. When the stock market rises sharply, most stock prices increase. When the market
                    falls sharply, most stock prices decrease. This happens regardless of how profitable a company is
                    and explains why recessions can adversely affect even the healthiest of stocks.
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Purchasing Power Risk</span> (also known as Inflation Risk) is
                    the risk that the inflation rate will be higher than the rate of return on an investment. Ideally,
                    the return rate on an investment needs to be at least as high as the inflation rate. Otherwise the
                    amount earned by the investor will have less purchasing power than it did when the initial
                    investment was made.<br>
                    <br>
                    For example, if you invest $100 and get a 10% annual rate of return, at the end of the year, you’ll
                    have $110. When you made the initial investment, inflation was hovering at 7% but due to a bad
                    economy, by the end of that year inflation is up to 15%. Your 10% investment return did not keep up
                    with the 15% rate of inflation and now your $110 will buy you less goods at the store.
