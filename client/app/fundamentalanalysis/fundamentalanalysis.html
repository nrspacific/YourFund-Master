            <p>Fundamental analysis was developed after the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These two laws require publicly traded corporations to provide full disclosure of financial and other information that can influence the price of their securities. </p>
            <p>Fundamental analysis uses formulas to examine the financial strength of a company.  Fundamental analysis involves looking into a company’s financial statements.  The analysis is based on factors such as the value of the company’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, earnings, dividends and other fundamental data.  Fundamental analysts look at this information to gain insight on a company’s future performance.  This analysis can help you determine if investing in a particular company is right for you.</p>
            <p class="text_ital">Fundamental analysis is useful in answering questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Is a company’s revenue growing?<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Is a company making a profit?<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Is a company strong enough to beat out its competitors in the future?<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Is a company able to repay its debts?<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Is a company’s management trying to “cook the books”?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can think of fundamental analysis as a toolbox to help you answer this question: Is the company’s stock a good investment?<br>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">Quantitative vs. Qualitative</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: none;">
                <p>A company’s fundamentals include everything from it’s market share to the quality of its management.</p>
                <p class="text_ital">These fundamental factors are grouped into two categories: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Quantitative</span> <br>
                    Quantitative fundamentals are the tangible factors of a business.  These are the numeric, measurable characteristics of a company.  A company’s financial statements are the biggest source of quantitative data.<br>
                    <br>
                    An example of quantitative analysis is the Price/Earnings or P/E ratio.  This ratio shows the amount of money investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings.  The equation is the price of a company’s stock divided by its annual earnings.  For example, if a stock sells for $50 per share and the company’s anticipated annual earnings are $5 per share, it carries a P/E ratio of 50/5 or 10.  The P/E ratio of a company with negligible earnings is meaningless.  A negative P/E ratio is sometimes found with new publicly traded technology companies.<br>
                    <br>
                    The P/E ratio can be used to estimate the attractiveness of a stock.  A company with a stock that has a low P/E ratio compared to its peers in the same industry could indicate that the stock is undervalued.  On the other hand, a low P/E ratio could indicate problems with the company if the stock price has had a very large decrease.  As an investor, you would want to look for a lower P/E number because this means that the stock is priced lower than those similar companies in that industry, but you also want to research the stock price history as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    The normal P/E ratio range for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index is 13 to 15 during a bull (rising) market and 8 to 10 in a bear (declining) market.  When the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 P/E ratio goes above the high end of that range, there is cause for alarm because the stocks are priced higher than their value.  Eventually, stock prices are likely to fall back down to their actual values.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can read more about financial statements in the Financial Statements section and can learn more about the various quantitative ratios in the Analyzing Financial Statements section.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Qualitative</span><br>
                    Qualitative fundamentals are the less tangible factors surrounding a business.  These include the quality of a company’s board members and key executives, its brand-name recognition, and its proprietary technology (i.e. patents).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Quantitative and Qualitative analysis</h4>
                <p>Many analysts study both qualitative factors and quantitative factors in analyzing a company. For example, when examining Apple corporation, an analyst might look at the stock’s annual dividend payout, earnings per share, P/E ratio, and many other quantitative factors. But the analyst will also take into account its brand recognition. Anybody can start a company that sells computers, but few companies on earth are recognized by billions of people. It’s tough to put your finger on exactly what the Apple brand is worth, but you can be sure that it’s an essential ingredient contributing to the company’s ongoing success.</p>

            <div id="CollapsiblePanel1" class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">What is intrinsic value? <br>
              </div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: none;">
                <h4>The concept of intrinsic value</h4>
                <p>There are two major assumptions of fundamental analysis.  The first assumption is that the price on the stock market does not fully reflect a stock’s “real” value.  This assumes that the stock market is not always correct and that some stock prices do not reflect their “real” value.  This “real” value is known as the intrinsic value.</p>
                <p> For example, a company’s stock was trading at $20 per share. After doing extensive homework on the company, you determine that it really is worth $25 per share. In other words, you determine the intrinsic value of the company’s stock price to be $25 per share. This is important because an investor wants to buy stocks that are trading below their estimated intrinsic value.</p>
                <p>The second major assumption of fundamental analysis is that in the long run, the stock market will reflect a company’s fundamentals. There is no reason to buy a stock based on intrinsic value if the price never reflects that value.  Unfortunately nobody knows how long “the long run” really is.  It could be days, months, or years.</p>
                <p>By focusing on a particular business, an investor can estimate the intrinsic value of a company and thus find opportunities where he or she can buy at a discount.  If all goes well, the investment will pay off over time as the market catches up to the fundamentals.</p>
                <p class="text_ital">There are two unknowns in determining a stock’s intrinsic value.  These are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">You don’t know if your estimate of the intrinsic value is correct.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">You don’t know how long it will take for the intrinsic value to be reflected in the stock market.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since qualitative factors represent aspects of a company’s business that are difficult or impossible to quantify, incorporating that kind of information into a pricing evaluation can be quite difficult.  But you should not ignore these intangible characteristics of a company.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div id="CollapsiblePanel2" class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">Internal qualitative factors<br>
              </div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text_ital">A company’s internal factors include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Business model</span><br>
                    A company’s business model describes exactly what the company does.  It’s how a company makes money.  A company’s website or the first part of its annual report can give a good overview of a company’s business model.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes business models are easy to understand. For example, McDonald’s sells hamburgers, fries, soft drinks, salads and whatever other seasonal special they are promoting at the time.  It’s a simple model, easy enough for anybody to understand.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, some business models can be complicated.  For example, you would think that the business model for Boston Chicken is a fast food restaurant selling cooked chicken.  The problem is that they didn’t make money by selling chicken. Instead they made their money from royalty fees and high-interest loans to franchisees.  Boston Chicken was actually nothing more than a big franchisor.  In addition, the management was aggressive with how it recognized its revenue.  When it was discovered that all the franchisees were losing money, the house of cards collapsed and the company went bankrupt.<br>
                    <br>
                    You should try to understand the business model of any company you invest in.  If you don’t understand a company’s business model, you won’t know what the drivers are for future growth, and you could leave yourself vulnerable to being blindsided like shareholders of Boston Chicken were.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Competitive advantage</span><br>
                    Potential investors should consider a company’s competitive advantage.  A company’s long-term success is due to its ability to maintain a competitive advantage.  Powerful competitive advantages, such as Coca Cola’s brand name and Microsoft’s domination of the personal computer operating system, create a moat around a business, allowing it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits. When a company achieves a competitive advantage, its shareholders can be well rewarded.<br>
                    <br>
                    One type of competitive advantage is called operational effectiveness.  Operational effectiveness means a company is better at performing similar activities than its rivals.  An example is Toyota which used “Just-In-Time” process improvements to produce automobiles quicker than Ford or GM.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Management</span><br>
                    A company relies upon its management to guide it towards financial success.  Strong management is important because even the best business model can fail if the company’s management fails to properly execute the plan.<br>
                    <br>
                    An investor can evaluate the management of a company by researching its website.  Every public company has a corporate information section on its website.  Usually there will be a short biography on each executive with their employment history, educational background and any applicable achievements. Be aware that companies put a positive spin on their management. A company doesn’t put negative information on its corporate website.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Here are a few ways to get a feel for the quality of a company’s management:</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Quarterly conference calls</span><br>
            <span class="ul2_indent">The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) hold quarterly conference calls. First, they review the financial results. Next is the interesting question-and-answer portion of the call.  This is when the analysts can call in and ask management direct questions.  The answers can be revealing about the company, but more importantly, listen for candor.  Do they avoid questions, like politicians, or do they provide forthright answers?<br>
              <br>
            </span><br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">The Management Discussion and Analysis is at the beginning of the annual report. The MD&amp;A is supposed to be frank commentary on the management’s outlook. Sometimes the content is worthwhile.  One insight is to compare what management said in past years with what they are saying now.  Is it the same material rehashed?  Have strategies actually been implemented?</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Ownership and insider sales</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">Large companies will compensate executives with a combination of cash, restricted stock and options.  It is a positive sign that management is also shareholders. The ideal situation is when the founder of the company is still in charge.  When a majority of management’s wealth is in the stock, you can have confidence that they will do the right thing.  It’s also worth checking if management has been selling its stock.  These sales have to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so it’s publicly available information.  Think twice if you see management unloading all of its shares while saying something else in the media.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Past performance</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">Another way to get a feel for management is to check and see how executives have done at other companies in the past. You can find biographies of top executives on company websites.  Like a resume, this shows the companies they worked at in the past.  It is a good idea to do a search on those companies and see their performance.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Corporate governance</span><br>
                    Corporate governance describes the corporate policies that explain the relationships and responsibilities between management, directors and shareholders.  These policies are defined and determined in the company charter and its bylaws.  The purpose of corporate governance policies is to ensure that proper checks and balances are in place, making it more difficult for anyone to conduct unethical and illegal activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Good corporate governance is where a company complies with all of its governance policies and applicable government regulations (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002).  With a little research and the right questions, investors can get a good idea about a company’s corporate governance.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Here are a some things to look for in corporate governance:</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Financial and information transparency</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">This aspect relates to the quality and timeliness of a company’s financial information and operational events.  Sufficient transparency implies that a company’s financial reporting is clearly written so that the stockholder can follow what management is doing and therefore have a clear understanding of the company’s current financial situation.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Stakeholder rights</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">This aspect of corporate governance examines how a company’s policies are benefiting stakeholder interests.  Shareholders should have some access to the board of directors if they have concerns or want something addressed. Companies with good governance give shareholders a certain amount of ownership voting rights to call meetings to discuss issues with the board.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Structure of the board of directors</span><br>
          <span class="ul2_indent">The board of directors is composed of representatives from the company and representatives from outside of the company. The combination of inside and outside directors tries to provide an independent assessment of management’s performance, making sure that the interests of shareholders are represented.<br>
          <br>
          The key word for the board of directors is “independence”.  The board of directors is responsible for protecting shareholder interests and ensuring that the management of the company is doing the same.  A board filled with insider representatives probably will not be objective critics of management and will defend their actions as beneficial, regardless of the outcome.<br>
          <br>
Information on the board of directors of a publicly traded company (such as biographies of individual board members) can be found in the DEF 14A proxy  </span></li></ul>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">External qualitative factors</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: none;">
                <p>Each industry is different in terms of its customer base, market share, industry-wide growth, competition, regulation, and business cycles.  Learning about the industry will give an investor a better understanding of a company's financial health. </p>
                <p class="text_ital">External factors include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Customers</span><br>
                    In general, it's not good if a business relies on a small number of customers for a large portion of its sales because the loss of a customer could dramatically affect revenues.  For example, a military supplier who has 95% of its sales with the U.S. government could lose the majority of its sales if there is a change in government policy.  For this reason, companies will always disclose in their annual 10-K report if any one customer accounts for a majority of revenues.</li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Market share</span><br>
                    A company that possesses an 85% market share tells you that it is the largest player in its market by far.  This could imply that the company possesses some sort of "economic moat," a competitive barrier that helps protect its current and future earnings.  Market share is important because of economies of scale.  When a company is larger than its rivals, it is in a better position to absorb the high fixed costs in a capital-intensive industry.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Industry growth</span><br>
                    One way to examine a company's growth potential is to determine if the number of customers in the overall market will grow.  This is crucial because without new customers, a company has to steal market share from its competitors in order to grow.<br>
                    <br>
                    In some markets, there can be little or no growth.  For example, a manufacturing company dedicated solely to creating audio cassette tapes might have been very successful in the '70s, '80s and early '90s.  However, that same company would currently have a rough time due to the advent of newer technologies, such as CDs and MP3s.  The current market for audio cassette tapes is only a fraction of what it was during the peak of its popularity.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Competition</span><br>
                    Examining the number of competitors in an industry helps in understanding the competitive landscape for a company.  Industries that are difficult to get into because of the infrastructure costs (i.e. utilities, telecommunications) or industries with a large number of competing firms can create a difficult operating environment for companies.<br>
                    <br>
                    One risk in a highly competitive industry is called pricing power.  This refers to the ability of a supplier to increase prices and pass those costs on to its customers.  Companies in industries that have few competitors can pass on costs to their customers.  An example of this is Wal-Mart. They are dominant in the retailing business and they practically set the price for many of its suppliers.  If you want to sell to Wal-Mart, you have little pricing power.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Regulation</span><br>
                    Certain industries are heavily regulated due to the importance of the industry's products or services.  These regulations can dramatically affect a company’s attractiveness as an investment.<br>
                    <br>
                    In industries where one or two companies represent the entire industry for a region (such as utility companies), governments usually specify how much profit each company can make.  In these instances, there is the potential for sizable profits, but these profits are limited due to regulation.<br>
                    <br>
                    In other industries, regulations can have an indirect effect on pricing.  For example, the drug industry is one of most regulated industries.  No one wants an ineffective drug that causes deaths to be sold on the market.  As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that new drugs must pass a series of clinical trials before they can be sold to the general public.  All this testing can take several years and millions of dollars before a drug is approved.  All these costs are above and beyond the millions of dollars that the drug company has spent on research and development.<br>
                    <br>
                    Investors should be on the lookout for regulations that could potentially impact a business. Investors should keep these regulatory costs in mind as they assess the potential risks and rewards of investing.</li>
