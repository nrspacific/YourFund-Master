          <p>Your Fund’s mission is to help investors achieve their financial goals by giving them the knowledge and
            tools they need to build and manage their own individual funds. </p>

          <p>Your Fund was created when we asked ourselves this question: If mutual fund managers can create a
            diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, why can’t an average investor do the same?</p>

          <p>Your Fund was designed by Neal Steiner, MBA, a Personal Financial Planner and investor with over 25 years
            of investing experience. Steiner posed the above question in a Series 7 broker licensing course, but neither
            his instructor nor his classmates could come up with a satisfactory answer. Now, Steiner and his team have
            done just that: created a way for the average investor to design and build an affordable, diversified
            portfolio customized to his or her needs.</p>

          <p>With Your Fund, individual investors can become better educated about investing and design and build their
            own affordable, diversified portfolio that can be tailored to their own personal goals.</p>

          <p>Whether you are a seasoned investor or just getting started, Your Fund can help you learn about investing
            and create customized funds that are tailored to your short-term and long-term financial goals.</p>
