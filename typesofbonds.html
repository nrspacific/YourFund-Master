            <p>[image of a corporate bond] A bond is a security issued by a company or government. When you purchase a bond you are loaning money to the bond issuer. The issuer is borrowing money from you, the buyer of the bond (bondholder) and has agreed to pay specific amounts to you, the bondholder, on the maturity date. These amounts are the periodic interest payments (you are not loaning the money for free, are you?) and the repayment of the bond principal.
            </p>
            <p>The bond’s face value and interest rate are specified ahead of time. A bond’s coupon rate (the interest rate stated on the bond) depends on the market interest rate when the bond was issued as well as on the creditworthiness of the bond issuer.  For example, you buy a $1,000, 5 year, 3% bond meaning that you will receive 3% interest annually for 5 years and then receive the $1,000 at the end of the 5 years. 
            </p>

            <p class="text_ital">Bondholders receive priority over common stockholders in two important ways: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">They must be paid interest before dividends are paid to stockholders. <br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">They receive priority if the issuer’s assets are liquidated (i.e. company goes bankrupt). 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Investing in bonds makes sense if you want the regular cash flow coming from the interest payments or if you do not need the money you invested right away. Bonds can be excellent for funding short-to-intermediate-term goals, since you can match the bond’s maturity date to the date you need funds.
            </p>

            <p>Usually, the longer the maturity of a bond, the higher its interest rate. That is because you are committing money for a longer period of time, so the bond issuer needs to compensate you for the length of time your money is tied up.
            </p>
            <p>The bad news is that bonds can also be risky investments depending on the issuer. They are susceptible to interest rate risk and inflation risk. Because a bond has a fixed coupon (interest) rate, when the price of a bond decreases, its yield increases to match the market interest rate.
            </p>

            <p>For example, say you purchase a $100 bond with a 10% coupon. One year later interest rates increase to 12%. The price of your bond on the market would drop. After all, why would someone buy a 10% bond when they can buy a 12% bond? Your 10% bond is not worth as much as a 12% bond, so if you wanted to sell it, you would need to sell it at a discount. It is important to note that when the stock market goes up, the bond market usually goes down and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>If the issuer is not financially strong, you would want a higher interest rate to offset the higher risk of the investment.
            </p>  
            <p>Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s are bond rating agencies which regularly publish their bond ratings. The ratings range from AAA for the safest bonds to D for highly speculative bonds which may even be in default. The ratings of A or better are given to investment grade bonds, while speculative bonds are rated lower than BBB.
            </p>
            <p class="text_ital">The following are types of bonds:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Callable bonds</span> [image of telephone], like other bonds, have a set maturity date. However, the bond’s issuer can call (redeem) the bond earlier than the maturity date. The issuer may do this if current market interest rates fall below the bond’s interest rate.  This is because the issuer would be paying a higher interest amount on the existing bonds.  For example, a company issues 5% bonds.  One year later, interest rates drop to 3%.  The existing bonds are paying 2% higher than the current market rate which is costing the company money.  The company calls in the bonds to reduce the interest it is paying.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Convertible bonds</span> [image of a convertible car] may be exchanged for a specified amount of other securities at the discretion of the bondholder. For example, the bond can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The owner of a convertible bond benefits if the price of the common stock rises.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Coupon bonds</span> [image of store coupons] pay interest at a stated annual rate (i.e. the coupon rate) with the annual payments usually divided into two equal semiannual installments. The coupon rate of a bond depends on the general level of interest rates at the time the bond is issued as well as the quality of the issuer. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Discount bonds</span> [image of a for sale sign] are issued at a discount from their face value and are redeemable at their face value on a specified date. There are no payments between the date of issue and the date of redemption. For example, you might pay $9,000 for a bond that will pay you $10,000 in five years. The discounted purchase price makes up for the fact that the bond pays no current interest. This is similar to a zero-coupon bond. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Guaranteed bonds</span> have interest or principal (or both) that are guaranteed by a company other than the bond issuer. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Income bonds</span> [image of a pile of cash] are unusual in that the interest is paid only if the corporation makes enough money to pay the interest. Most income bonds are regarded as speculative (risky). <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Mortgage bonds</span> [image of a house] are secured by a mortgage on a property or properties. <br><br></li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Secured bonds</span> [image of a commercial building like a factory] are backed by the company’s assets. For example, mortgage bonds are secured by a conditional lien on part or all of a company’s property. If the company defaults (i.e. fails to pay interest or repay principal), the bondholders may foreclose the mortgage and take over the pledged property. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Tax-exempt bonds</span> are bonds where the interest is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. These are usually state and municipal government bonds. The interest rate is lower, but depending on your tax bracket, their after-tax returns may be higher than other types of bonds that are not exempt from federal taxes.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Unsecured bonds</span>, also known as debentures, are protected only by the general credit of the borrowing entity. All bonds issued by federal, state, and municipal governments in the United States are unsecured. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Zero-coupon bonds</span> [image of a store coupon with a slanted red slash thru it]  do not have regular interest payments. Instead, they are purchased at a discount and mature at a higher face value. For example, you might pay only $9,000 for a bond that will pay you $10,000 in five years. The discounted purchase price makes up for the fact that the bond pays no current interest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these bonds are either <span class="text_bld">Registered bonds</span> or <span class="text_bld">Bearer bonds</span>. For registered bonds, the issuer maintains records on ownership. A bearer bond is more like cash in that whoever has physical possession of it is the owner. Registered bonds are safer because the bonds are registered to the person who purchased them and the issuer maintains the records.<br>
