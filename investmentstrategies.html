            <p>Just like there are many routes to choose from when you travel (i.e. the freeway, highway, city streets), there are various strategies for investing. Which ones you choose depend on how much time and effort you want to devote. Some investors buy stocks and hold them for many years. Other investors take a more involved approach by trading frequently. This is not the same as trading on a daily basis (e.g. day trading) which can be dangerous to your financial and mental health, unless you thrive on major stress. There is no one correct strategy and many investors use a combination of strategies for their investments. </p>

                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Active investment strategies</span> [image of someone at a gym] attempt to outperform the performance of the overall stock market. One of these strategies involves purchasing individual stocks based on analysis of the company’s fundamentals. This strategy includes buying stocks priced below their perceived value (stocks that are price inexpensively relative to their peers) or stocks with low Price/Earnings ratios. <br><br>

                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Passive investment strategies</span> [image of someone in a hammock sipping a drink] do not attempt to outperform the market. Instead, the objective is to do as well as the market. This can be achieved through Indexing - investing in an indexed portfolio designed to duplicate the performance of a market index such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500. <br><br>

                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld"> Combination Strategy</span>, [image of a multi-layered sandwich] another type of passive strategy, divides the portfolio into active and passive components. Indexed funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be used for the passive component while selective purchasing and selling of stocks and bonds can be used for the active component.

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Dollar Cost Averaging</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <p>Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an automatic system where you invest equal amounts of money at regular intervals (weekly, monthly, etc.) into a specific stock, regardless of the price of the shares. With this system, you purchase more shares when the stock price is low and fewer shares when the stock price is high.
                </p>
                <p>For example, you buy $100 of xyz stock at $10.00 per share which is 10 shares.  Next month, you buy $100 of xyz stock at $12.00 per share which is 8.33 shares.  The following month, you buy $100 of xyz stock at $14.00 per share which is 7.14 shares.  Over that three month period, you paid $300 and own 25.47 shares (10 + 8.33 + 7.14).  The dollar cost average is $300 divided by 25.47 shares or $11.78 per share.
                </p>
                <p>DCA cannot guarantee a profit or prevent a loss. However, it does reduce the effects of market fluctuations over the long term. The investor invests the same amount of money whether the share price is high, low or in between. The DCA system helps the investor avoid impulse buying and selling.

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
                <h4>Buying / Holding a Stock<br>
                </h4>
                <p>[image of someone hugging money] It is important to be able to evaluate a stock in order to determine whether it is worth purchasing. The first step in analyzing a stock is to look at the company’s profile. This profile includes factors such as the price/earnings ratio, dividend rate, dividend yield and growth in future earnings. You can access a company’s profile on our website’s Research Detail page. 
                </p>
                <p>The company’s position in the industry (are its products desirable), current economic conditions, and your risk tolerance level will help determine your stock selections. A time-tested strategy is to invest in an undervalued stock.  This is based on the fact that over time the price of a stock will tend to rise towards its perceived value, but as always with investing, there is no guarantee that the stock price will rise.
                </p>
                <h4>Selling a Stock<br>
                </h4>
                <p>If you are playing blackjack and have won seven hands in a row, do you walk away from the table? Do you think, “I’m on a roll and I can keep going” or do you think, “I’ve made a good profit and I’m going to walk away?”
                </p>
                <p>Selling a stock requires discipline. It can be extremely difficult to determine the right time to sell a stock. When a stock price rises, greed can get in the way of taking profits. There is an adage that says “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs just get slaughtered!”
                </p>
                <p>When a stock price falls, it is reasonable to postpone selling because you hope the stock price will recover and rise back up. But if the stock does decline, will it ever recover to your initial purchase price or will it languish at a lower price? Given your time frame, how long do you wait to see if the stock will recover? These are factors to consider if the stock price declines.
                </p>
                <p>If a stock was undervalued when it was first purchased and is still undervalued, then it makes sense to hold it until it becomes appropriately valued. If it is no longer undervalued, then it is a prime candidate for selling, regardless of how well it is performing at this time. This rule keeps emotions and greed out of the decision process.
                </p>
                <p>After a stock has met your goals, unless there are overriding considerations, it should be sold. It is also appropriate to sell a stock if the reason the stock was purchased is no longer valid. An example would be purchasing a stock of a drug company which introduced a miracle drug. If the product fizzles, it is best to face the facts and sell the stock.
                </p>
                <p>Spectacular success syndrome – Quite often a large rapid price increase signals trouble for a stock. For example, a technology stock, during one month, might skyrocket from 75 per share up to 135 per share based on either good results or speculation. On a stock graph, it would look like the ascent of a rollercoaster with a very sharp incline, not a gradual slope upwards. Often when this happens, the stock will become overvalued quickly, and like a rollercoaster, will decline very quickly as well. 
                </p>
                <p>There is no consistent way to determine the peak of the stock price. If the stock price appreciation has met your criteria and goals for that stock on the way up, it probably is best to sell, even if the stock continues its ascent. If you have a longer timeframe, you could ride the stock up and then down and hope it goes back up, but there is no guarantee that the stock price won’t descent below your purchase price.
                </p>
                <h4>Selling a Bond<br>
                </h4>
                <p>You can sell a bond before it matures if you need the money sooner than you expected. You may also sell a bond before it matures if the bond has increased in value due to a decrease in current market interest rates. For example, your bond has a stated interest rate of 12%, but the current interest rate is 9%.  Your bond’s value has increased since you are earning 12% interest while a new bond would only earn 9%.  Bonds are interest-sensitive, therefore fluctuations in interest rates and future interest rate movements can play a role in determining when to sell. Alternatively, you could hold the bond until it matures.
